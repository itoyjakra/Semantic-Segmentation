# Semantic Segmentation
### Introduction
The goal of the project is to label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.
